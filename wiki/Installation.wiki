#summary Installation of the OpenCL Programming Guide sample code

= Introduction =

The sample code for the OpenCL Programming Guide was designed to work on a variety of OpenCL 1.1-compatible devices and platforms.  This page details instructions on building the sample code for a select set of platforms.  The code has been tested on Mac OS X 10.6.8, Microsoft Windows 7, and Ubuntu Linux 11.04.  The sample code has been tested using the AMD, Nvidia, and Apple OpenCL implementations.


= Prerequisites =

The OpenCL sample code depends on the following libraries:

  * An OpenCL v1.1 implementation for your platform/device
  * [http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/ FreeImage]
  * [http://www.boost.org/ Boost]

Please download/install the appropriate OpenCL implementation for your platform along with FreeImage and Boost before attempting to build the sample code.

= Checkout the source code ==

Instructions for checking out the source code from Subversion can be found at [https://code.google.com/p/opencl-book-samples/source/checkout].  Checkout the code to a local folder using a Subversion client on your platform and return to this page for further instructions.

= Building the source code ==

The following sections describe how to build the source code for each of the platforms that the code has been tested on.

== Microsoft Windows 7 w/ Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 ==

 * Download and unzip the FreeImage DLL installation from [http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/download.html] to a location on your disk such as c:\FreeImage
 * The easiest way to install Boost on Windows is to use the install from Boost Consulting available at [http://www.boostpro.com/download/].  Download and install the latest version of Boost (tested with v1.4.7 as of this writing).
